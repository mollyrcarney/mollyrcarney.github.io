The U of A Paleoethnobotany Lab is set up for the identification and analysis of archaeobotanical and ethnobiological materials. Our lab features Leica microscopes and imaging systems for the analysis and documentation of a variety of archaeological remains and comparative specimens. We prioritize macrobotanical and starch extraction, processing, and identification. Our botanical comparative collections include seeds, wood, geophytes, starch, and herbarium voucher specimens, with a regional focus on the North American Pacific Northwest and the Eastern Woodlands. We are in the process of buidling this collecion and imaging these reference materials. Once imaged these will be uploaded to the [Northwest Native Plants](nwnativeplants.org) website.

We welcome students from all backgrounds and interests into the Paleoethnobotany Laboratory. I am currently looking for undergraduate volunteers to help us organize and digitize our reference collections and to help sorting and identifying archaeological samples. Some remote opportunities are available. Please email [Dr. Carney](mailto:mc143@uark.edu) to get started.

I am actively recruiting graduate students to join our lab group. Students interested in any aspect of environmental archaeology or the study of past human-environmental interactions are welcome to apply. Please contact me directly with questions about our graduate program or to discuss your potential application.
