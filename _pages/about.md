I an environmental archaeologist who uses paleoethnobotanical, geoarchaeological, and computational tools to explore how past people interacted with and related to natural and built environments. More specifically, I am interested in understanding the relationships between people, plants, landscapes, and environments. 

My research focuses on camas (*Camassia* spp.), an edible bulb common throughout the North American Northwest. My doctoral work identified that this plant was managed or stewarded by Indigenous peoples over the past 3,500 years through distinct selective harvesting practices; but that despite significant human input to the lifecycles of these plants, we have no phenotypic evidence that camas was domesticated. 

My postdoctoral research program seeks to expand upon these findings. Specifically, my collaborators and I are working on understanding three things about Northwest peoples diets in the past: what were people eating in conjunction with camas, further expanding on how they were manipulating, managing, or stewarding past camas communities and ecosystems, and understanding the ways past climate regimes affected those management practices. For the fellowship I will model how paleoclimatic trends may have expanded or contracted past camas niches, which can then be compared with archaeological data on camas management. This work prioritizes collaboration with tribal nations and state and federal agencies, with a goal of creating informed management plans for camas that account for millennia of human input as well as future global warming and aridification. This work is also designed to contribute to ongoing Indigenous food security movements and revitalizations. We further envision extrapolating these workflows to other cultural keystone plant foods in the future.

I also have research interests in the architectural signatures of past Columbia-Fraser Plateau places and employ feminist, Indigenous, and agency-focused lensâ€™ to reframe past and present discussions on regional household archaeology. I am further strongly committed to collaborative, inclusive, and multivocal archaeology and anthropology, and to bridging gaps between cultural resource management, academia, and the communities who have lived in the Plateau region since time immemorial. 

I am currently a [Washington Research Foundation Postdoctoral Fellow](https://www.wrfseattle.org/grants/wrf-postdoctoral-fellowships/) at [Washington State University](https://anthro.wsu.edu/). I earned my PhD at Washington State University in Anthropology in 2021 where I was awarded Harriet B. Rigas Award for Outstanding Doctoral Students.
